# TrilaterationPointSet
The notebook outlines how to find a set of coordinates that minimise the MSE with respect to the distances measures between the points. This can be used for surveying and geolocation applications.

## Method
Uses numerical optimisation via a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm to find the minimum of function of one or more variables.
